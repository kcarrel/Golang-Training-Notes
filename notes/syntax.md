Main is a special name declaring an executable rather than a library
Init runs first - the init function exists to initialize data for any packages with init function, not only for the main package.

```
package main

func init() {

}

func main() {

}
```

Packages is where functions live and one package can contain many files that you can name them freely.

Note: One important rule for constructing a package is â€œthere must be only one package per one folder


Import declaration declares library packages referenced in this file

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

Functions are defined by:
func main() {

}

**3 ways to declare a variable**

```
var first string 
first = "This is a string."

var second = "This is a string."

third := "This is a string."
```

**Variable Types**
If you declare a variable without assigning any value - the variable is set to zero value of its type
```
 a := 1    // var a int
  b := 3.14 // var b float
  c := "hi" // var c string
  d := true // var d bool
  fmt.Println(a, b, c, d)

  e := []int{1, 2, 3} // slice
  e = append(e, 4)
  fmt.Println(e, len(e), e[0], e[1:3], e[1:], e[:2])
  
  f := make(map[string]int) // map
  f["one"] = 1
  f["two"] = 2
  fmt.Println(f, len(f), f["one"], f["three"])
```
- int
- float
- string
- boolean
- slice (can appends its element into the back of it)
- array (similar to slice but fixed length)
- struct (similar to C)
- map
```

// map
import "fmt"

type Person struct{
  Name    string `json:"name"`
  Age     int    `json:"age"`
  isAdmin bool
}

func main() {
  p := Person{
    Name:    "Mike",
    Age:     16,
    isAdmin: false,
  }
  fmt.Println(p, p.Name, p.Age, p.isAdmin)
}


```

**Type conversion**
Some pairs of type can convert by casting directly (int(1.23), float(3), uint32(5)), but for some require an extra library to do a conversion such as string-int, int-string, bool-string, and string-bool.
```
example
    a := 3.14
    b := int(a)
```

**Control Flow**

```
    if/else 

    if a > a thing {
    } else if a != another thing {
    } else {
    }


    switch

    a := thing 
    switch a {
        case "Case1":
            a = "bloop"
        case "Case2"
            a = "No":
        default:
            a = "Y"
    }
```

**Loops**
```
    for i := 0; i < a; i++ {
        the thinggg
    }

    for a > thing {
        a--
    }

    a := []int{0, 2, 3, 5}
    for _, i := range a {
        salkj
    }
```
## Command Line Arguments
os.Args is a slice of strings.

In go - a *slice* is a dynamically sized sequence s of array elements where individual elements can be accessed as s[i] and a contiguous subsequence s[m:n]


Constants:
- true
- false
- iota
- nil

Types:
- int
- int8
- int16
- int32
- int64
- uint
- uint8
- uint16
- uint32
- int64
- float32
- float64
- complex128
- complex64
- bool
- byte
- rune
- string
- error

Functions:
- make
- len
- cap
- new
- append
- copy
- close
- delete
- panic
- recover
- complex
- real
- imag

Stylistically: Go programmers use camel case

Declarations:
- var
- const
- type
- func

Pointers:
Declaring a pointer = var pointer_name *Data_Type
ex: var s *string
```
// normal variable declaration
var a = 45

// Initialization of pointer s with 
// memory address of variable a
var s *int = &a
```

The lifetime of a *variable* is the interval of time during which it exists as the program executes. A *package-level variable* is the entire execution of the program. 

```
x = 1                               // named variable
*p = true                           // indirect variable
person.name = "bob"                 // struct field
count[x] = count[x] * scale         // array or slice or map element

v := 1
v++ // goes to 2
v-- // goes to 1
```

Tuple assignment allows several variables to be assigned at once. 

```
func gcd(x, y int) int {
    for y != 0 {
        x, y = y, x%y
    }
    return x
}
```

```
i, j, k = 2, 3, 5
```

**Assignment**

implicit assignment
```
medals := []string{"gold", "silver", "bronze"}
```
explicit assignment
```
medals[0] = "gold"
medals[1] = "silver"
medals[2] = "bronze"
```

**Package Initialization**
- package level variables are initialized in declaration order, but after any of the variables they depend on
- Initialization of variables declared in multiple files is done in lexical file name order. Variables declared in the first file are declared before any of the variables declared in the second file.
- Initialization cycles are not allowed.
- Dependency analysis is performed per package; only references referring to variables, function, and methods declared in the current package are considered.

**Scope**
A declaration associates a name with a program entity, such as a function or variable. The *scope* of a declaration is the part of the source code where a use of the declared name refers to that declaration.
